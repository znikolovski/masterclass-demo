# Send to Adobe Target (Experience Workspace)

Help authors export the **currently open** DA page or fragment to Adobe Target as an immutable HTML offer, using the in-browser **Send to Adobe Target** extension — the EW equivalent of [Prepare → Send to Adobe Target](https://docs.da.live/administrators/guides/prepare-menu/send-to-adobe-target).

## Runtime constraints (read first)

This skill is for the **Experience Workspace agent**, not a local IDE agent.

| Available | Not available |
|-----------|----------------|
| User’s EW session (Adobe IMS already signed in) | Running `node`, shell scripts, or repo CLI tools |
| **Library → Send to Adobe Target** extension UI | Reading `.hlx/.da-token.json` or running **da-auth** |
| Coaching, checklists, troubleshooting | Calling `ims-na1.adobelogin.com` or `mc.adobe.io` directly from chat |

**The agent cannot perform the export.** It guides the author through the extension and interprets errors.

## When to use

- “Send this to Target” / “export to Adobe Target” while editing in EW
- Creating or updating an offer from a **page** or **fragment** (e.g. `/fragments/columns-featured`)
- Deleting a linked Target offer
- Extension errors: preview URL, CORS, missing config, empty `<main>`

## Prerequisites (confirm with the author)

Ask or verify before guiding export:

1. **Target credentials in DA** — Sheet `adobe-target` under the site’s `/.da` folder with `tenant`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`. Open in DA: `https://da.live/#/{org}/{site}/.da` → sheet **adobe-target**. Do **not** preview or publish this sheet.
2. **Library extension registered** — Site config **library** tab includes **Send to Adobe Target** pointing at the project’s `tools/adobe-target/adobe-target.html` on the preview host (code bus on `main`).
3. **Code synced** — After extension fixes ship, author may need a hard refresh in EW (~2–5 minutes after merge to `main`).
4. **Document previewed** — The page or fragment must be **previewed** in DA (export uses preview HTML).
5. **Supported content** — Pages and fragments only (not sheets or media).

**This site:** org `znikolovski`, site `masterclass-demo`, preview host `https://main--masterclass-demo--znikolovski.aem.page`.

## Author workflow (what you guide)

Walk the author through these steps in order:

1. **Open the document** in Experience Workspace (page or fragment they want to export).
2. **Preview** the document if it is not already on the preview tier (Sidekick / publish flow — use EW UI labels the author sees).
3. Open **Library** (sidebar).
4. Select **Send to Adobe Target** (fullsize dialog).
5. In the dialog:
   - If an offer is already linked, they see **Update offer** or **Delete offer**.
   - Otherwise enter an **offer name** (suggest a clear name from the path, e.g. `Columns Featured` for `/fragments/columns-featured`).
6. Click **Create offer** or **Update offer**.
7. Wait for success message; the extension writes `adobe.target.offerId` into the document **metadata** block.

### Suggested offer names

| Source path | Suggested name |
|-------------|----------------|
| `/fragments/columns-featured` | Columns Featured |
| `/index` | WKND Homepage |

Adjust if the author prefers their Target naming convention.

## Agent workflow (EW chat)

Use this checklist in the conversation — do not run terminal commands:

```
- [ ] Confirm which document is open (page vs fragment path)
- [ ] Confirm document is previewed
- [ ] Confirm adobe-target sheet exists in /.da (ask if unsure)
- [ ] Guide: Library → Send to Adobe Target
- [ ] Confirm offer name or update/delete intent
- [ ] If error: map to troubleshooting table below
- [ ] On success: remind author offer lives in Target; DA is source of truth
```

**If the author asks you to “do it for them”:** Explain that export runs only inside the extension in their browser session; provide the numbered steps above and stay on the thread while they click through.

## What gets exported

Per [DA documentation](https://docs.da.live/administrators/guides/prepare-menu/send-to-adobe-target):

- HTML inside **`<main>`** from the **preview** URL (undecorated section markup)
- Offer type: immutable **XF HTML** offer in Adobe Target
- DA stores `adobe.target.offerId` in a **metadata** table on the same document

## Troubleshooting (extension messages)

| What the author sees | What to tell them |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Preview did not return a URL | Ensure the doc is **previewed**; retry after preview completes. Extension expects `preview.url` from the preview API. |
| CORS / IMS token failed | Hard-refresh EW so the latest extension loads (uses DA **ETC CORS proxy**, not direct IMS). Confirm code sync on `main` completed. |
| Could not load `/.da/adobe-target.json` | Add or fix the **adobe-target** sheet under `/.da` with tenant, clientId, clientSecret. |
| Preview HTML has no `<main>` | Open the preview URL in a tab and confirm the page renders a full document; fragments should still include `<main>` on preview. |
| Extension / dialog 404 | Library path must resolve on preview host: `…/tools/adobe-target/adobe-target.html`. Wait for code sync, then hard-refresh. |
| Could not connect to the editor | Reload EW; reopen the document; open the extension again from Library. |

**Do not** suggest local token files, `da-auth`, or Node scripts to EW authors.

## Classic DA (optional)

If the author also uses classic Document Authoring, the same flow exists under **Prepare → Send to Adobe Target** (OOTB plugin, no custom path). EW uses the **Library** entry instead because there is no Prepare menu.

## Security reminders (tell admins, not secrets)

- `clientSecret` belongs only in the unpublished `/.da/adobe-target` sheet
- Never paste credentials into chat
- Offers in Target are immutable; update/delete from DA or the extension, not by editing HTML inside Target

## Out of scope unless asked

- **Delivery** of Target offers on the live site (at.js, alloy, mboxes) — see [Fragments](https://www.aem.live/docs/fragments) and the DA doc delivery section
- **Fragment inclusion** on pages — use the Fragment block / Fragment Picker, not this skill
